# WHCC Interaction/Front-End Engineer Case Study
Create a **private** [mirror copy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository) of this repo in your own Github account.

Please add your WHCC contact to that repo as a collaborator when you're done.

The purpose of this case study is for us to better understand where your technical expertise is at.

# Description
Make this scaffolded app look and behave as described in the screenshots and video below.

Some work has already been done in the index.html file.
Please do not use a framework, just vanilla javascript or typescript.
You may use webpack, babel, or any other compiler you're comfortable with.
You may also use ES6, do not worry about supporting ES5.
Try to timebox your work to approximately 1-2 hours.

You may change anything provided to fit your needs, be it DOM structure, CSS, or javascript.

# Requirements
1. For simplicity, assume you're targeting a greenfield browser (no need for polyfills)
1. Non-image files should be rejected when dropping on the gallery area at the bottom of the page.
1. When dragging files onto the gallery drop zone, the dashed line should change color.
1. Clicking on a gallery photo will display it in the main content area. The selected photo should also have a gray border when selected with a blue border when hovered.
1. The displayed photo should display some metadata about it in the sidebar content area, including the file name, mime-type, and human-readable size of the image.
1. Each section on the sidebar should have a subtitle to describe what it does with the styling demonstrated in the video/screenshots.
1. The sidebar area should apply clips and filters (provided in the CSS) to the image in the main content area with the styling demonstrated in the video/screenshots.


# Core Values of Design
1. Polished simplicity in the user experience and aesthetic.
1. Focus on empathy for the userâ€™s experience.

# Resources
1. Watch an [interaction demo](https://www.loom.com/share/3d399d1bb85c4869aea30df23aaaa7cf) online.
1. There are screenshots of the initial and populated state available in the `/screenshots` directory.
1. There are test images available in the `/images` directory.


# Discussion Notes
1. What decisions did you make before you began development?
1. How did you decide what to work on in order to meet the time constraint?
1. What was your decision making process for your code organization?
1. If you had more time, what would you have implemented?
